# Roadmap

## Next steps

### 1. Improve the look and feel of the UI

Most of the initial work was spent on the blockchain and backend functionality. The UI is currently very basic, and it needs to be improved to be more user friendly.

### 2. Allow paying with other tokens

Using Chainlink Price Feeds, we can allow users to pay with other tokens, such as LINK, ETH, or DAI.
