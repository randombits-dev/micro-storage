# Roadmap

## Next steps

### 1. Improve the look and feel of the UI

Most of the initial work was spent on the blockchain and backend functionality. The UI is currently very basic, and it needs to be improved to be more user friendly.

### 2. Allow sharing of storage accounts

Allow users to create multiple storage accounts, with the ability to share them with other users by sharing the NFT.

### 3. Handle previewing uploaded files

Allow the user to preview files in the browser, like PDF files and images.
